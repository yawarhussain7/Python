1. Topic TypeCasting 

 Type casting is a technique that convert `one data type into another datatype ` such as 
 we can convert integer dataype into float datatype 

There are two type of TypeCosting:

    1. Implicit typecosting
    2. Explicit Type Costing

1. Implicit TypeCosting in a method in which `Compiler automatically convert ` One data type into another data type

Example

    a = 5
    b = 2.1

    sum = a + b         # programming form

    sum = 5 + 2.1       # mathematical form

    sum = 7.1           # Result become 

    Explain:    in this example compiler implicitly convert int data type into float datatype

2. Explicit TypeCosting is a method in which `Programmer convert Explicitly ` One data type into another data type

Example:
        num1 = 3
        num2 = 3.4

        sum = num1 + int(num2)

        in this example we convert Explicity the type of `float` into  `int `
